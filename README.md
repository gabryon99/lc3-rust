## LC3 - Emulator

LC3-rust is a virtual machine for the Little Computer 3 architecture, written using the Rust programming language.

The VM has been written just for didactic purpose and for practicing Rust (therefore, the code may not be the best :))

See the tutorial here: [Write your Own Virtual Machine](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) by Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendleton
